Developed a heterogeneous ensemble model to classify brain tumors in multi-classes based on MRI images leveraging the combination of deep learning and ML.

Extracting features with DenseNet and ResNet, classifiers were then trained, with best accuracy of 13 classifiers recovered with Ridge Classifier (97% accuracy).

Applied SHAP to achieve interpretability, giving an understanding of the importance of features of each class.
